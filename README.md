##Description
This is a school project, a Python-based machine learning model to predict tsunami occurrences using historical seismic and oceanographic data. Utilized libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, 
and TensorFlow for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

This Model uses synthetic data, so the data is generated and not based on real tusmanis that occured.
